Extension ggsysinfo for eZ publish
===================================

Goals:

Allow eZ Publish administrator user to have better insight into its working installation:
- have the complete informations from the phpinfo() page within the eZ Publish admin interface
- have the complete informations from the installed php accelerator within the eZ Publish admin interface, and, in case,a llow to clear its cache
- have a more detailed view on eZ Publish cache files, allowing to grep through them and delete them if needed
- have a more detailed view on eZ Publish log files, allowing to grep through them
- have a stats page with all types of content in the db listed
- have a page with more detailed status tests than ezinfo/isalive


Requirements:

- eZ Publish 4.0 or later
- eZ Publish cluster mode is not supported yet for the cache info part
- Zend Accelerator, Turck MMCache and IonCube are not supported for the opcode cache part 


Installation:

- As per standard eZ Publish extensions: drop in extension dir, activate in site.ini override file or via gui
- fix the autoload config: if not activated via the admin interface, run the ezpgenerateautoloads.php script
- if using eAccelerator, make sure that the  eZ Publish dir is within the eaccelerator.allowed_admin_path setting in php.ini
- to have the connecting-to-the-web and connecting-to-email-server tests activated, go edit sysinfo.ini.append.php.
  By default these tests are deactivated since they involve active probing of external resources
- Access to all views this module is regulated by granting access to the "setup/system_info" policy.
  To allow anonymous access to a single view, the ini setting PolicyOmitList can be also used.


SECURITY:

- DO NOT RUN THIS APP WITHOUT REWRITE RULES ENABLED!
  You would be giving any user the power to reset your php accelerator's cache at any time (if it sounds like an easy dos target, it is because it is)
