Changes from 0.3 to 0.4 - released 2010/11/1

New:
- added a page listing all operations defined by modules
- added a new 'Content classes report' page, where all content classes definition is available at a glance
  Thanks A. Sebbane, the first contributor of hopefully a long series!
- added 3 "QA" pages to check for common problems with ini settings files and php files

Improved:
- added a test for connectivity to the solr backend in the 'System status' page when eZFind is activated
- hide Sysinfo tab in admin2 design for users that cannot access it anyway
- better display of some pages using the admin design (old Administration Interface)
- in the 'Content stats' page, show the number of pending notification events and indexation events
- do not show the 'phpinfo()' page anymore for eZP versions 4.1 and above, that already have it

Fixed:
- the test for cluster-file-handler database would fail on recent ezp builds, where the name of the handler changed (tanks A. Sebbane)
- fix the links used for displaying source code on pubsvn (list of modules/views and fatch functions): migrated to github
- fix a warning in searching files and some cache dirs that do not exist (eg. disabled caches) on windows
- in log display, show log messages generated from cli scripts
- links to online docs now point to http://doc.ez.no
