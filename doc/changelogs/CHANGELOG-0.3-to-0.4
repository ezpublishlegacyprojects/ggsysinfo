New:
- added a page listing all operatiions defined by module

Improved:
- added a new 'Content Classes report' page, where all content classes definition is available at a glance
- added 3 "QA" pages to check for common problems with ini settings files and php files
- added a test for connectivity to the solr backend in the system status page when eZFind is activated
- hide Sysinfo tab in admin2 design for users that cannot access it anyway

Fixed:
- the test for cluster-file-handler database would fail on recent ezp builds, where the name of the handler changed (tanks A. Sebbane)
