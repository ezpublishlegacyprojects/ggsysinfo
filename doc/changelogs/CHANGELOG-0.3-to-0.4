Changes from 0.3 to 0.4 - released 2010/xx/yy

New:

Improved:
- added a new 'Content Classes report' page, where all content classes definition is available at a glance
- added two "QA" pages to check for common problems with ini settings files
- added a test for connectivity to the solr backend in the system status page when eZFind is activated

Fixed:
- the test for cluster-file-handler database would fail on recent ezp builds, where the name of the handler changed (tanks A. Sebbane)
- fix the links used for displaying source code on pubsvn (list of modules/views and fatch functions): migrated to github
