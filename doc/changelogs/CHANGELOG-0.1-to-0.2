Changes from 0.1 to 0.2 - released 2010/04/25

- Added complete, detailed list of active modules, views, fetch functions, policy functions, with parameters (where available) and links to online docs
- Added a graph of all files stored to disk per minute (cache files plus storage)
- renamed sysinfo.ini.append.php to sysinfo.ini, as it is the correct name for added ini files
