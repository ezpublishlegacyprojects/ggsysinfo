Changes from 0.4 to 0.5 - released 2011/yy/zz

New:

Improved:
- small iprovement in the display of the list of module operations: indicate required parameters
- renamed 'pending notifications' to 'pending notification events' in "content stats" view, as eZP will generate notification events even when no user has actually subscribed to be notified of anything

Fixed:
- link to highlight source code of views in extensions (when ezgeshi extension is available) was not working
- compatibility with eZP 4.5 and later
